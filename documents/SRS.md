# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the functional and non-functional requirements for the NFT Marketplace Smart Contract. This system allows users to create, auction, bid, and purchase NFTs using blockchain technology.

### 1.2 Scope
The NFT Marketplace Smart Contract facilitates:
- Minting and listing NFTs for auctions or direct sales.
- Managing bids on auctioned NFTs.
- Transferring ownership of NFTs upon successful bids or purchases.
- Handling royalties and listing fees.

### 1.3 Definitions
- **NFT**: Non-Fungible Token, a unique digital asset stored on the blockchain.
- **Smart Contract**: Self-executing contract with terms directly written into code.
- **Auction**: A bidding process to determine the highest price for an NFT.

### 1.4 Overview
This document details the functional requirements, system architecture, and constraints of the NFT Marketplace Smart Contract.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The NFT Marketplace Smart Contract is implemented on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. It uses the ERC-721 standard for NFTs and integrates OpenZeppelin libraries for security and extensibility.

### 2.2 Product Features
- Mint NFTs with metadata.
- List NFTs for auction or direct sale.
- Place bids on NFTs.
- Claim NFTs after winning an auction.
- Manage royalties and listing fees.
- Retrieve all, sold, unsold, or user-specific NFTs.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
The primary users of the system are:
- **Sellers**: Users who mint and list NFTs.
- **Buyers**: Users who bid on or purchase NFTs.
- **Administrators**: Manage listing fees and royalties.

### 2.4 Constraints
- Transactions require Ethereum for gas fees.
- Smart contract functions must adhere to Ethereum’s gas limits.
- Users must have a compatible Ethereum wallet.

### 2.5 Assumptions
- Users have basic knowledge of blockchain and Ethereum wallets.
- The contract operates on a live Ethereum network.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Minting NFTs
- **Input**: Token URI (string).
- **Output**: A unique NFT token ID.
- **Constraints**: Only the owner of the contract can mint.

### 3.2 Listing NFTs for Auction
- **Input**: Name, description, image, token URI, price.
- **Output**: NFT listed for auction.
- **Constraints**: Price must be greater than zero; listing fee must be paid.

### 3.3 Placing Bids
- **Input**: Token ID, bid amount.
- **Output**: Bid recorded.
- **Constraints**: Bid must be higher than the current price; auction must be active.

### 3.4 Claiming NFTs
- **Input**: Token ID, bid index.
- **Output**: NFT transferred to the highest bidder.
- **Constraints**: Auction must have ended; caller must be the highest bidder.

### 3.5 Buying NFTs
- **Input**: Token ID, payment amount.
- **Output**: NFT ownership transferred.
- **Constraints**: Payment must equal or exceed the listing price.

### 3.6 Managing Listings
- **Input**: Token ID, new price.
- **Output**: Updated price.
- **Constraints**: Caller must be the NFT owner.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance
- All transactions must execute within Ethereum’s block time.

### 4.2 Security
- Prevent reentrancy attacks using OpenZeppelin’s `ReentrancyGuard`.
- Restrict sensitive operations to authorized users.

### 4.3 Usability
- Provide clear error messages for failed transactions.

### 4.4 Scalability
- Support a large number of NFTs and users.

## 5. System Architecture

### 5.1 Smart Contract Components
- **ERC721URIStorage**: Manages NFT metadata.
- **ReentrancyGuard**: Protects against reentrancy attacks.
- **Counters**: Tracks total NFTs.

### 5.2 Key Data Structures
- **AuctionStruct**: Stores auction details.
- **BidderStruct**: Tracks bids on NFTs.

### 5.3 Key Functions
- `createAuction`: Lists an NFT for auction.
- `placeBid`: Records a bid.
- `claimPrize`: Transfers NFT to the winning bidder.
- `buyAuctionedItem`: Allows direct purchase of an NFT.

### 5.4 Gas Optimization Strategies
- Minimize state updates by leveraging memory variables.
- Batch operations to reduce redundant calls.
